        When the pacman is not in danger, it should function similarly to the LeftTurnAgent. That is, it
        turns left whenever possible. If not possible it runs until it canâ€™t go any further in the current
        direction, then tries a right turn or U-turn. If no action is possible, sets the action to
        Directions.Stop.

        Based on the direction from which the pacman is in danger, we
        select a new direction. We check for legal directions in the following order: reversing the
        current direction, turning to the left, then turning to the right. If none of these are legal, we
        continue in the direction of the danger, or stop if no move is legal (only possible in contrived
        boards)
